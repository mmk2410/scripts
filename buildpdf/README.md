## buildpdf.sh
**buildpdf** is a small script for LaTeX users who want to generate a pdf from their LaTeX source code in regular periods.

### How to use

To use it download the script from GitLab and make it executable with

```
chmod +x buildpdf.sh
```

Then run it:

```
./buildpdf.sh filename [build amount] [time between builds in s]
```

You have to give a filename as an argument and you're able to set, how much builds you wanna create and how much time should be between these builds.
